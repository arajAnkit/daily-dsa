/*
Problem Statement
Given an integer n, write a function that returns true if n is a palindrome number, and false otherwise.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same forward and backward. For example, “racecar” and “121” are palindromes, but “hello” and “123” are not.

Example
Input: n = 131
Output: true
Explanation: 131 is a palindrome number, as it is the same when reversed.
